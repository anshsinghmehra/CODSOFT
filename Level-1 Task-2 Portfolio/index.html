            <h3>Line Follower Robot using Arduino </h3>
            <br>
            <p>Line follower Robot is a very simple robot that follows a line, either a black line or a white line. These type of robots are very simple to build and is often the first choice for beginners who are getting started with robotics. Basically, there are two types of line follower robots: one is a black line follower which follows the black line and the second is a white line follower which follows the white line. Line follower actually senses the line and follows it. Though the idea sounds simple, with a little more development, robots similar to this are practically used in many applications like factory floor management robots or warehouse robots. We also made an Arduino UNO Line Follower Robot, you can check out the demonstration video given below:</p>
